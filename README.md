An Android app created for the Lebanese American University - mobile app competition of 2021.
This app basically allows users to rent their objects to others with an intuitive UI and a realtime firebase database.
The app was intended to be adopted by a company (but I didn't drag it further).

The code was last edited on 11:39PM, 23/04/21 and is _not_ a GitHub repo. It has only been archived here for preservation purposes.
A debug APK built from when the source tree was active is provided for preservation purposes as well.

To build, use Gradle 6.5 and Android Studio. Most likely needs updating anyway to build in 2024 and beyond and might rely on deprecated Firebase methods or contracts.
Do NOT contact me about this unless there's a copyright infringement issue of some sort (which there shouldn't be anyways - but this is from 2021, so I have no idea).
